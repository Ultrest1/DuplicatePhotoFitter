# Privacy Policy – Duplicate Photo Fitter
**Last updated:** [22 Feb 2026]

Duplicate Photo Fitter (“the App”) is operated by **[Your Name / Company]** (“we”, “us”, “our”).  
This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the App.

## 1) Summary
- The App is designed to analyze your photo library to find duplicates/similar photos.
- Photo analysis is performed **on-device**. We do **not** upload your photos to our servers.
- The App may use third-party services for subscriptions and/or ads, which may collect limited device and usage data.

## 2) Information We Collect / Access
### a) Photos (Device Photo Library)
- If you grant permission, the App can access your photo library to detect duplicates/similar photos.
- **We do not transmit your photos to our servers.**
- Photo processing happens locally on your device.

### b) Purchase & Subscription Data
If you purchase a subscription, we use a third-party provider (e.g., **RevenueCat**) to manage entitlements and subscription status.
- This may include purchase receipts, subscription status, and an app-scoped user identifier.

### c) Advertising Data (If Ads Are Enabled)
If the App shows ads, we may use advertising partners (e.g., **Google AdMob**) that can collect:
- Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID / IDFA if available and permitted)
- Approximate location (inferred from IP)
- App interaction and ad performance data

### d) Analytics / Diagnostics (Optional)
We may collect basic diagnostics (crash logs, performance data) to improve stability and user experience.
This data typically includes device model, OS version, and app version.

## 3) How We Use Information
We use information to:
- Provide core features (duplicate detection, cleaning workflow)
- Verify purchases and manage subscriptions
- Show ads (if enabled) and measure ad performance
- Fix bugs, prevent fraud/abuse, and improve the App

## 4) Sharing of Information
We do not sell your personal information.  
We may share limited information with service providers only as necessary to operate the App, such as:
- **RevenueCat** (subscription management)
- **Google AdMob** (ads, if enabled)
- Crash/analytics providers (if enabled)

These providers process data under their own privacy policies.

## 5) Data Retention
- Photos are processed on-device and not stored on our servers.
- Subscription-related records are retained as needed to provide access and comply with legal obligations.
- Diagnostics/analytics data (if enabled) may be retained for a limited time by the provider.

## 6) Security
We take reasonable measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 7) Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## 8) Your Choices & Rights
- You can revoke Photos permission anytime in iOS Settings.
- You can manage subscriptions in your Apple ID subscription settings.
- If applicable under your local laws (e.g., GDPR/CCPA), you may request access/deletion of certain data we control.

## 9) International Users
Your data may be processed by third-party providers in countries other than your own. These providers rely on legal mechanisms to transfer data where required.

## 10) Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be posted here with a revised “Last updated” date.
