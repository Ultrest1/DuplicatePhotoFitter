  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: <strong>February 22, 2026</strong></p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Duplicate Photo Fitter</strong> (“the App”) handles information.
    The App is designed to help you find and manage duplicate photos on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>We do not collect or store your photos on our servers.</strong> Photo analysis and duplicate detection
    are performed locally on your device.
  </p>

  <h3>Information processed on-device</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Photos and metadata accessible via your iOS photo library permission are used only to show duplicates inside the App.</li>
    <li>This data stays on your device unless you choose to delete items from your library.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Purchase & subscription information</h3>
  <p>
    If you purchase a subscription, purchase status is processed by Apple’s App Store and our subscription provider
    <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to validate entitlements (e.g., whether “Pro” is active).
  </p>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may use the following services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple App Store / StoreKit</strong> – to process purchases and manage subscriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> – to manage subscriptions and verify purchase entitlements.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These providers may process limited data required to provide their services (e.g., subscription status, identifiers).
    Their handling of data is governed by their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Analytics & Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Currently, the App does not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs that track you across apps and websites.
    If we add analytics/ads in the future, we will update this policy accordingly.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data. We do not upload your photos to any server.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not keep a server-side database of your personal information. Subscription status is retained by Apple
    and RevenueCat as needed for purchase validation.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect information handled by the App. Photos are processed on-device and are not transmitted to us.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can revoke Photos permission anytime in iOS Settings.</li>
    <li>You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID subscription settings.</li>
  </ul>
